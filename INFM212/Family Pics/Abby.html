      <h2> About Abby </h2>
      <p> My youngest sibling is my sister Abby. She is currently a senior at Cass High School and she soon plans to graduate and attend Shorter University. </p>
      <p> One thing about my sister is she is in love with music. She is an amazing singer and she has done all 4 years of band and marching band at Cass. When she is not at school she loves to just be with freinds and family and relax. </p>
