<h4>The Websites I Like</h4>
<ul>
    <LI> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target = "_blank"">Amazon </a> - Amazon is a huge buisness today. I like their website because the homepage is clean and the site is so easy to navigate. You can type what you're looking for and you can scroll through multiple pages of product to find what youre looking for.
    <LI> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target = "_blank"">Youtube </a> - Youtube has a very welcoming home page. The home page gives you lots of content based on the popularity of videos.
    <LI> <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target = "_blank"">Apple </a> - Apple has a website that is very clean and aethstically pleasing. I am a huge fan of Apple and I enjoy their products.
</ul>

<h4>The Websites I Dont Like</h4>
<ul>
    <LI> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target = "_blank"">Facebook </a> - Facebook has a home page that is too full of random information. The page seems chaotic and is not something I use often.
    <LI> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target = "_blank"">Reddit </a> - Reddit is a useful website but their landing page is full of jumbled information. The website is good, but you may not wanna see the info they force you to see on the landing page.
    <LI> <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports?ocid=StripeOCID" target ="_blank""> MSN Sports </a> MSN Sports has a good page of all the sports and recent scores, but the ads and the aesthetic isn't pleasing.
</ul>
